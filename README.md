# Senior-Thesis
Senior Thesis in 2022-2023 Academic Year

The full thesis can be found under the longbottom_thesis pdf document. This is the final version, but does not display the signatures of the thesis acceptance. A link will be provided once the document is uploaded to insitution's digital commons.

The images in the code are uploaded directly from my computer so they will need to be downloaded and uploaded through one's own computer to rerun the code directly.

Based off work from https://github.com/fverdoja/LAD-Laplacian-Anomaly-Detector 


All files include all 5 satiellite images used in Verdoja and Grangetto's paper "Graph Laplacian for image anomaly detection".
