Based off work from https://github.com/fverdoja/LAD-Laplacian-Anomaly-Detector 

The NearestNeighbors file contains the Laplacian Matrix, along with an additional two versions of the exponential distance matrix. The NextNearestNeighbors file contains the exponential distance matrix that uses the 13 nearest pixels around it (the 4 nearest along with the 9 next nearest neighbors).
